# Labyrinth 1.0 - the game

A simple maze game I've coded for a school project back in 2006. 

Repo contains a compiled `.exe` file. Runs on Windows 10 without problems.

Originally coded in Delpi 7 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)

For maze generator to create a perfect maze with one and only solution I've used the [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm). 
Take a look into some other [maze generating algorithms](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap) - they are interesting.

To start the game just click the button in the middle and try to get into the green spot avoiding enemies.
Have fun! :)
