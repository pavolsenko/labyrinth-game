# Maze game

A simple maze game I've coded for a school project back in 2006. 

Repo contains compiled .exe file. Runs on Windows 10 without problems.
Originally coded in Delpi 7 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)
For maze generator I've used the Kruskal's algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm

To start the game just click the button in the middle and try to get into the green spot avoiding enemies.
Have fun! :)
